    Ensures:
    list L of lists, where each list has the structure of
    consultStatus.readServicesFile, representing the services to be provided
    in a period starting in the beginning of the period p upon they having
    been reserved as they are represented in reservations_p;
    Reservations with earlier booking times are served first (lexicographic
    order of clients' names is used to resolve eventual ties);
    Drivers available earlier are assigned services first (lexicographic
    order of their names is used to resolve eventual ties) under
    the following conditions:
    If a driver has less than 30 minutes left to reach their 5 hour
    daily limit of accumulated activity, he is given no further service
    in that day (this is represented with a service entry marhed with
    "terminates");
    Else if a vehicle has less than 15 kms autonomy, it is recharged
    (this is represented with a service entry marked with "charges") and
    is available 1 hour later, after recharging (this is represented with
    another service entry, marked with "standby").
    in this list L:
    drivers terminating their services earlier have priority over the ones
    terminating later;
    in case of eventual ties, drivers with less accumulated time have
    priority over the ones with more accumulated time;
    lexicographic order of drivers's names decides eventual ties
    in each case above.
